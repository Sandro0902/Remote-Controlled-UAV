# Latency analysis

The aim of this directory is to store logged data and scripts used for analyis of latency of the UAV testbed. Logged data is stored in data/ directory and files follow this convention: ground for ground test, air - 1m above the ground and farair - 2m above the ground. 


## Running the code 

To run the code these requirements have to be met: 
- Installed version of Python 3.6 
- Install dependencies that include: jupyter_notebooks, matplotlib, numpy, pandas and possibly another missing library

Then launch jupyter-notebook in this direectory, open flight_test_analysis.ipynb notebook and run all the necessary cells to obtain the figures.
